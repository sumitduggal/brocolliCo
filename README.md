This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with typescript template and is modified to install **TailwindCSS** to style the react app.

## Setting the project

Install all the node dependecies using
`cd into-project`

then run `yarn` to install all declared dependencies

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This command is configured to start the app using `react-scripts` and also watches over
any changes to `tailwind.css` in the `assets` folder to generate the `tailwind.generated.css` which is used for the project

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
